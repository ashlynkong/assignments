This output file contains expenditures on postage that exceeded $100. These 175 rows constituted less than 6% of the 3064 total postage-related transactions but accounted for over 40% of the total dollar amount spent in this category. Private companies like Fedex and UPS are the most common recipients in this file rather than the government-run USPS, which could indicate a general preference for private companies and/or that their services tend to be more expensive.
